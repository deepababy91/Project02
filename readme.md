1)My name is Deepa Baby

2)Overview/description of the project:
This is my second project for the Web development bootcamp. This is a Giphy search website.Users are able to type in a 
search phrase,click submit(used search icon here) , and the site will query the Giphy API based off the search that the user has entered.
After clicking on the search button, they can see the related gifs returned.

3)Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered:
Search for any word in the search area and the user can see the gifs related to that returned as results.I used Jquery/get to request data from an API , and display images on the screen.Used fail function in Jquery get to alert an error message whenever there is an error in the URL provided.
Styling done using CSS flexbox and grid.Used css animation for images and navbar links.
I used media queries to make the page responsive.The page view will be different for mobiles, ipad, laptop,desktop(all the devices).
Bootstrap used for getting the darkly theme but I customized it using css.


4)Technologies used:
HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, Jquery.

5)Ideas for future improvement:
I would like to return the count of gifs.

I would like to include upload and create options for GIF maker.

I would like to include categories option.
