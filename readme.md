1)My name is Deepa Baby

2)Overview/description of the project:
This is my second project for the Web development bootcamp. This is a Giphy search website.Users are able to type in a 
search phrase,clicked submit , and the site will query the Giphy API based off the search that the user has entered.
After clicking on the search button, they can see the related gifs returned.

3)Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered:
There is a navigation bar aligned to the sides of the header with multiple links. 
Search for any word in the search area and the user can see the gifs related to that returned as results.I used Jquery/Ajax to request data from an API , and display images on the screen.
Styling done using SASS.Mostly used flex for navbar ,search area and images.
The view is different for desktop, laptop and mobile phones. Used media queries for that.

4)Technologies used:
html,css,bootstrap, jquery, SASS.

5)Ideas for future improvement:
I would like to animate gifs.

I would like to include upload and create options for GIF maker.

I would like to include categories option.
